        <h3>Important Information Regarding Bulk Order Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          We understand that circumstances can change, but due to the unique considerations involved in fulfilling
          large, bulk orders (such as specialized sourcing, production, and inventory management), we are unable to
          provide refunds.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy applies to all aspects of your order, including: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li> Order Cancellations: Once an order is placed, it cannot be canceled.</li>
          <li>Product Returns: No returns will be accepted for any reason, including changes of mind, order errors, or
            dissatisfaction with the products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Damaged Goods: While we take every precaution to ensure your order arrives safely, damage during shipping
            may
            occur. In such cases, please contact us immediately with photographic evidence of the damage. We will
            investigate and may offer a partial credit or replacement at our discretion.
          </li>
        </ul>
