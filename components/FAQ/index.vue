          <h3>How can I choose the right laptop for my needs?</h3>
          <p>
            Selecting the right laptop depends on your specific requirements.
            Consider factors such as intended use (work, gaming, or multimedia),
            processing power, storage capacity, and portability. Our
            knowledgeable staff can guide you based on your preferences and
            budget.

          <h3>What's the difference between LED and OLED TVs?</h3>
          <p>
            LED TVs use a backlight to illuminate pixels, while OLED TVs have
            pixels that emit their own light. OLED TVs generally offer deeper
            blacks and more vibrant colors. The choice depends on your viewing
            preferences and budget. We can help you understand the differences
            and find the perfect TV for your space.
